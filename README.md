Programming Experience:


9th Grade Year: In the space below, write 2-5 sentences describing your programming experience in the previous year, even if you went to another school.
Basic coding experience such as: Assigning key strokes, making my computer sing, coding dice programs and card programs, coding lego robots, etc. I really cant remember much.


10th Grade Year: In 2-5 sentences, describe each of the programming projects you’ve completed this year.  Think back to Block 1, Block 2/3, and your Passion Project (if that applies).
I think the card coding and dice coding was actually this year. I dont think we have done much else this year.


What is one part or element of programming that you would like to improve or grow in this year?
I'd like to be able to write code fluently instead of writing it in choppy pieces


What is one part of programming or this class that you feel like challenges you more than others?
Questions about the coding are what get me, I can do it but I hate motivating myself to answer questions about it. 


What is your “goal” with computer programming or Computational Thinking?  This answer can be focused on your time at school, or it could describe how you want to experience college or your future career.

I'd like to be able to do basic level coding just to have that skill up my sleeve if I were to ever need it for a personal project or somethig of the sorts.
